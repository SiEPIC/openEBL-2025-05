# Design Review – Peer Assessment

**Note:** All times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The current course time is:

---

## Part 1 – Your Response: Design Submission

**Deadline:** Please check the course schedule.

1. Ensure that you have completed and uploaded your **GDS layout**.
2. Ensure that the layout has been **successfully merged** and passes all automated checks.
3. Similarly, upload your **design document (.pdf)** and record the filename.

### Step 1: Your Response
Provide the filenames that your peers will use to evaluate your design:

- **Design document:** The filename of your PDF document.  
  _Note: This is not strictly required to participate in the design review._
- **Layout:** The filename of your GDS layout, which has been merged into `EBeam.gds`.  
- **IMPORTANT:** Include your **fork name** (found [here](https://github.com/SiEPIC/openEBL-2025-05/forks)) so peers can find the latest version of your layout.

## Part 2 & 3 – Design Review: Peer Assessment

**Deadline:** Please check the course schedule.

Each participant will evaluate the layouts of several peers using the **Design Review Checklist** as a rubric.

### Steps:

1. **Step 1: Your Response** – Already completed (see above).
2. **Step 2: Learn to Assess Responses**  
   Practice by assessing a sample design:  
   `EBeam_ImaginaryStudentA.gds`  
   _Note: This file was created with an older version of KLayout/SiEPIC tools. The verification feature may not work._
3. **Step 3: Assess Peers**  
   - Evaluate the designs submitted by your peers.  
   - Submissions will appear once peers have submitted. If none appear, check back later.
   - Use the links your peers provided to access their designs.
   - Download the **EBeam.gds** merged file and locate the peer’s layout. 
     **IMPORTANT:** If a layout is missing from the merged layout, also check the forks. Your peer may not have submitted a pull request.
